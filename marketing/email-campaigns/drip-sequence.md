# Seasonal Tips Reference

## Spring (March-May)
"Water new lawns 1-2x daily for the first 2 weeks. Gradually reduce to deep watering 2-3x per week."

## Summer (June-August)
"Water early morning (before 10am) to reduce evaporation. Raise mower height to 3-4 inches to protect roots from heat."

## Fall (September-November)
"Perfect time to install sod! Cooler temps reduce stress and roots establish before winter."

## Winter (December-February)
"Sod CAN be installed in winter! Roots grow slowly but establish well for a spring green-up."
