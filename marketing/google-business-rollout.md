## Risk Mitigation

### DO:
- Space out listing creation (never same day)
- Use different Gmail accounts per listing
- Vary business name slightly
- Get real reviews from real customers
- Post unique content to each listing
- Use different photos or different order

### DON'T:
- Create 10+ listings in one week
- Use same phone for multiple listings
- Copy/paste identical descriptions
- Use same photos in same order
- Have listings with zero reviews for months
- Ignore listings after creation

---

## Review Strategy Per Location

### Week 1-2 (Post-Verification):
- Ask 2-3 past customers in that area to review
- Offer nothing in exchange (violates TOS)

### Month 1:
- Goal: 5 reviews minimum
- Email/text customers after completed jobs

### Ongoing:
- Every completed job in that city = review request
- Respond to every review within 24 hours
- Goal: 20+ reviews per listing within 6 months

## ROI Calculation

Each Google listing can generate 5-20 leads/month once established.

At $50/lead value:
- 5 listings × 10 leads × $50 = $2,500/mo
- 15 listings × 10 leads × $50 = $7,500/mo
- 35 listings × 10 leads × $50 = $17,500/mo

**Breakeven: ~2-3 leads per listing per month**
