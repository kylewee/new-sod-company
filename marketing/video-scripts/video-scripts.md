**Duration:** 2 minutes
**Purpose:** Answer objections, SEO

**[SCENE 1: Host intro - 10s]**

HOST: "Got questions about sod installation? Let me answer the top 5 questions we get asked."

**[SCENE 2: Question 1 - 20s]**

TEXT: "How much does sod cost?"

HOST: "Prices typically range from 65 cents to a dollar per square foot, depending on your location and grass type. For a 5,000 square foot lawn, expect around $4,000 to $5,500 fully installed. That includes material, labor, and delivery."

**[SCENE 3: Question 2 - 20s]**

TEXT: "What's the best grass for my area?"

HOST: "It depends on your climate. In Florida, St. Augustine is the go-to. Texas does well with Bermuda. For shady yards, Zoysia is a great choice. Not sure? Our quote form recommends the best option for your city."

**[SCENE 4: Question 3 - 20s]**

TEXT: "How long does installation take?"

HOST: "Most residential lawns take 4 to 6 hours. We can usually schedule within 5 to 7 days of your booking. So from quote to finished lawn, you could be looking at about a week."

**[SCENE 5: Question 4 - 15s]**

TEXT: "When is the best time to install sod?"

HOST: "Honestly? Any time. Sod can be installed year-round. Spring and fall are ideal, but summer and winter installations work fine with proper watering."

**[SCENE 6: Question 5 - 15s]**

TEXT: "What if my sod doesn't take?"

HOST: "That's why we offer a 30-day installation warranty. If properly watered and the sod doesn't establish, we'll replace it. Simple as that."
