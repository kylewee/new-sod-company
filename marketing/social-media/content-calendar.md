Week 4+: Transition to 2-3x per week, deep watering

### Wednesday - Customer Story
**Caption:** "My home sold in 3 days."

[NAME] was getting ready to list their [CITY] home and knew the lawn needed work. They called us on a Thursday, we installed on Tuesday, and the house was under contract by Friday.

First impressions matter. Curb appeal sells homes.

Thinking of selling? New sod averages a 15x ROI on resale value.

### Tuesday - Education
**Caption:** SOD VS SEED: The Real Comparison

SEED:
- $0.05-0.20/sqft
- 8-12 weeks to establish
- Requires perfect conditions
- Birds and runoff = patchy results
- Multiple reseedings often needed

SOD:
- $0.65-1.00/sqft
- Instant lawn, usable in 2 weeks
- Works in any season
- Guaranteed coverage
- One-time installation

When you factor in time, failed attempts, and water bills... sod usually wins.

### Wednesday - Customer Story
**Caption:** 3 dogs. 2 kids. 1 unbelievably durable lawn.

When [NAME] came to us, their old lawn was destroyed from years of high traffic. They needed grass that could handle their active family.

We recommended Bermuda for its durability and fast recovery.

6 months later? It still looks like day one.

### Thursday - Behind the Scenes
**Caption:** What 450 sqft of fresh sod looks like (one pallet)

Each pallet covers about 450 square feet - that's enough for most front yards.

Fun fact: Fresh sod weighs about 2,000-3,000 lbs per pallet. That's why we bring the equipment to move it!

Swipe to see it go from pallet to lawn.
